				<li class=rule>The Game of Amazons is a turn-based board game, played by two players.</li>
				<li class=rule>Every turn consists of two phases.</li>
				<li class=rule>First phase involves moving any amazon(queen) of your color. They move like normal chess queens and can't jump over or capture anything.</li>
				<li class=rule>In second phase the amazon you just moved needs to shoot an arrow, which also moves like a chess queen. The square it lands on, burns out and becomes inaccesible. No amazons or arrows will be able to land or go over this square.</li>
				<li class=rule> The person who can't move any of their amazons loses and their opponent wins.</li>
